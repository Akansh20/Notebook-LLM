Variations on Absorptive Capacity Theory
The sources describe a few differences between the traditional view of absorptive capacity and how the researchers applied the theory in their study.
●
Traditional Emphasis on External Knowledge: The traditional view of absorptive capacity emphasizes the acquisition and exploitation of externally generated knowledge.
●
Study's Focus on Internal and External Information: The researchers in this study broadened this definition to include both external and internal information processing and use. They argue that in the context of business analytics (BA) and innovation, focusing solely on external information is too limiting.
●
Integration of Data-Driven Culture: The researchers also incorporated data-driven culture as a core component of a firm's absorptive capacity. This culture emphasizes the value of data, analytical decision-making, and the use of data-based insights. The sources argue that a data-driven culture enhances a company's ability to both acquire and effectively use information, whether from external sources or generated internally through BA.
Differences in Component Separation
Traditionally, absorptive capacity is separated into potential absorptive capacity (acquisition and assimilation) and realized absorptive capacity (transformation and exploitation). The researchers in this study, however, argue that these stages cannot be clearly separated in their context:
●
Overlapping Roles of BA and Environmental Scanning: They posit that different types of BA (descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive) blur the lines between these stages. For example, descriptive BA contributes to the assimilation of information (potential absorptive capacity), while predictive and prescriptive BA bridge the gap between potential and realized absorptive capacity. Similarly, environmental scanning is viewed as contributing to all stages of absorptive capacity (acquisition, assimilation, and exploitation).
The researchers' application of absorptive capacity theory reflects an adaptation of the traditional concept to a specific context—the use of BA for innovation. They broadened the scope to include internal information and the role of data-driven culture, and they challenged the clear-cut separation between potential and realized absorptive capacity. This adaptation allows for a more nuanced understanding of how organizations leverage data and analytics to drive innovation.


4. Analysis of Response

Accuracy: The response accurately identifies how the researchers adapted absorptive capacity theory, highlighting both the traditional segmentation of absorptive capacity and the study’s continuous approach.
Effectiveness: The response is clear and suitable for anyone trying to understand how the researchers modified the theoretical framework for their study.
Strengths: Concisely explains both the traditional and adapted views, giving a quick but thorough comparison relevant to the study’s model.
Weaknesses: More detail could be added about why the researchers chose this integrated approach, such as how it better suits BA’s role in ongoing organizational processes.
5. Reflections and Recommendations

Overall Reflection: NotebookLM’s response demonstrates its strength in comparing theoretical adaptations, a useful feature for academic analysis.
Recommendations: For more complex theoretical distinctions, it would be helpful if NotebookLM provided additional context or rationale behind the adaptation choices made by the researchers.
