NotebookLM Experiment Logs

This repository contains logs and analyses of experiments conducted using Google’s NotebookLM. The purpose of these experiments is to evaluate NotebookLM’s effectiveness in summarizing and interpreting academic research papers, specifically focusing on Understanding the Impact of Business Analytics on Innovation. Each experiment demonstrates NotebookLM's ability to summarize, respond to specific queries, and compare theoretical concepts.

Overview of Experiments

Summarizing Research Paper
Objective: Evaluate NotebookLM's ability to generate a concise summary of a full research paper.
Experiment File: Paper_Summary_Experiment_1.md
Description: The research paper was uploaded, and NotebookLM generated a summary focusing on the main aim, methodology, and findings of the study.
Key Findings: NotebookLM provided a clear and concise summary, effectively highlighting the study’s core insights while omitting some detailed methodological aspects.

Identifying Theoretical Lens
Objective: Determine if NotebookLM can accurately identify and describe the theoretical framework used in the research paper.
Experiment File: Paper_Theory_Identification_Experiment.md
Description: A query was made to identify the theoretical lens the researchers used to inform their model. NotebookLM correctly identified absorptive capacity theory and provided a brief explanation.
Key Findings: NotebookLM accurately responded, though more contextual depth could enhance the output.

Comparing Traditional and Adapted Theoretical Views
Objective: Assess NotebookLM’s ability to compare the traditional view of absorptive capacity with the researchers’ adapted application in the study.
Experiment File: Paper_Absorptive_Capacity_Theory_Differences.md
Description: The experiment involved asking NotebookLM about key differences between the traditional and adapted views of absorptive capacity. NotebookLM effectively summarized the distinctions.
Key Findings: NotebookLM provided a well-structured comparison but could benefit from additional context about the researchers' rationale.
