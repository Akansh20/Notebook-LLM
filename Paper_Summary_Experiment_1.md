Summary of the Research Paper: Business Analytics and Innovation Through the Lens of Absorptive Capacity
This research paper investigates how business analytics (BA) contributes to innovation, specifically new product/service innovation, within organizations. Recognizing a gap in the literature regarding the mechanisms through which BA impacts innovation, the authors adopt absorptive capacity theory as a theoretical framework.
Defining Concepts and Establishing the Model
The paper starts by defining key concepts, acknowledging that while BA, encompassing descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive analytics, is not new, its ability to handle Big Data presents a significant opportunity for innovation. Similarly, data-driven culture, characterized by valuing and utilizing data in decision-making, is seen as essential for realizing the full potential of BA.
Building on the foundation of absorptive capacity, which refers to an organization's ability to recognize, assimilate, and apply new information, the authors propose a research model. This model outlines the relationships between:
●
BA, which is seen as the tool for acquiring and processing information
●
Environmental scanning, the purposeful gathering of information about the external environment (clients, competitors, customers, technology, and markets)
●
Data-driven culture, the internal environment that influences how information is valued and used
●
New product/service innovation (newness and meaningfulness), the outcome of effectively utilizing information
●
Competitive advantage, the ultimate organizational benefit of successful innovation
Key Hypotheses and Findings
The paper then proposes and tests several hypotheses, which are summarized below along with the key findings:
●
H1 – BA has a positive effect on Environmental Scanning: Supported. This confirms that BA tools and techniques can be used to enhance the acquisition of external information.
●
H2a – Environmental Scanning has a positive effect on New Product Newness: Supported. This reaffirms the importance of understanding the external environment for developing novel products/services.
●
H2b – Environmental Scanning has a positive effect on New Product Meaningfulness: Supported. Gathering information about customer needs, preferences, and trends is crucial for developing products/services that are relevant and valuable.
●
H3a – New Product Newness has a positive effect on Competitive Advantage: Supported. Developing novel products/services can contribute to a firm's competitive advantage in the marketplace.
●
H3b – New Product Meaningfulness has a positive effect on Competitive Advantage: Supported. Creating products/services that are meaningful to customers leads to stronger competitive advantage compared to just focusing on novelty.
●
H4 –BA has a positive effect on Data-Driven Culture: Supported. Using BA strengthens an organization's data-driven culture by demonstrating the value of data and insights.
●
H5 – Data-Driven Culture has a positive effect on Environmental Scanning: Supported. When data is valued and used in decision-making, organizations are more likely to engage in purposeful information gathering.
●
H6a – Data-Driven Culture positively moderates the relationship between Environmental Scanning and New Product Newness: Rejected. This suggests that data-driven culture does not necessarily amplify the impact of environmental scanning on the development of novel products/services.
●
H6b – Data-Driven Culture positively moderates the relationship between Environmental Scanning and New Product Meaningfulness: Supported. A data-driven culture enhances the impact of environmental scanning on developing meaningful and customer-centric products/services.
The Nuances of Absorptive Capacity and Environmental Scanning
The study further clarifies the relationship between traditional absorptive capacity and its application to environmental scanning in this context. The authors acknowledge that while the traditional view emphasizes acquiring and exploiting externally generated knowledge, their model broadens the scope to include both external and internal information processing.
Furthermore, the study's focus on environmental scanning as part of absorptive capacity is distinct from market orientation as a business strategy. While market orientation is a strategic choice, environmental scanning can be adopted by any organization regardless of its strategic orientation. The key is to purposefully gather and utilize information about the external environment to support innovation.
Limitations and Future Research
The study acknowledges some limitations. It was conducted solely in the UK, potentially limiting generalizability to other contexts. The model also doesn't capture all factors influencing innovation success, such as business strategy, leadership, and inter-firm networks, focusing solely on the role of BA and absorptive capacity.
The authors suggest several avenues for future research:
●
Testing the model in other geographical contexts and across different types of innovation
●
Examining the impact of BA on other business outcomes, such as long-term sustainability
●
Employing qualitative approaches to gain deeper insights into how BA adds value to organizations
Conclusion
This research paper provides a valuable contribution to understanding how BA can be leveraged for innovation. By applying absorptive capacity theory and emphasizing the importance of data-driven culture and environmental scanning, the study offers practical guidance for organizations seeking to maximize the impact of BA on new product/service development.
